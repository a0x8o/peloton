// This file defines the QoS advisor to Peloton interfaces.
// QoS IDL needs to be checked in to the Peloton repo because Peloton will
// need client-side bindings for the API. For external users of Peloton,
// QoS is an optional component that; if not present then certain advanced
// functionality (such as load-aware placement) will not work. Basic use case
// will continue to work. External users can provide their own implementations
// of QoS, and as long as those adhere to this IDL, Peloton should be able to
// utilize that external QoS.
