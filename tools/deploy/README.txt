- Thrift python package version is 0.9.2.post6 and thrift compiler
      version is 0.9.3

- Command to generate thrift types:
      thrift --gen py:new_style,slots,utf8strings --out . aurora/api.thrift

- Delete __hash__ from aurora/api/ttypes.py generated by thrift 0.9.3

    The __hash__ function generated by thrfit 0.9.3 is incompabitable
    with thrift 0.9.2post6 python package so we have to manually delete
    __hash__ functions

- Test the client:
      (env)min-osx:python min$ PYTHONPATH=. python aurora/tests/test-aurora.py
